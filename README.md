# Angptl4-in-NAFLD-immunopathologies

The project contains the R scripts of the bulk and single-cell transcriptomes of our diet-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) mouse model. We formulated a specialized diet (Liver Disease Progression Aggravation Diet; LIDPAD) that can accelerate NAFLD progression in C57BL/6J mice when they are housed at thermoneutral condition (~ 30 degree Celcius). Manuscript 1 is under review by Advanced Science.

## R scripts
"LIDPAD model" folder contains the Rscripts for the following analyses:
  1. Bulk liver transcriptomes of LIDPAD- (and control diet-) fed mice at Week 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 32 and 48 post feeding.
  2. The establishment of a human transcriptomic-guided disease staging approach.
  3. Liver transcriptomes of MASH mice given diet reversion.

"Liver immune landscape" folder contains the scripts for the following analyses:
  1. "scRNAseq" folder contains the scripts to annotate the intrahepatic immune clusters, identify the differentially expressed genes, functional enrichment and psedotime trajectory.
  2. "mAb treatment liver RNAseq" folder contains the Rscripts to perform differential expression analysis between the liver transcriptomes of control diet-fed mice, untreated, cAngptl4 mAb treated and LysMCre-Angptl4-knockout LIDPAD-fed mice.
